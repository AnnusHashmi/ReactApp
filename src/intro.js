           <p>
               This is a asssingment given to us and so far things look pretty okay here <br />But cant say
               the same thing about whats next to come. As for now i am on my vacations and therefor can do my tasks
               on time, but cant the same about when my uni is back again! I think i have done enough babbling on This
               and this should be good enough to give me an idea about how things work! The best thing i have noticed right now
               is that im actully loving this keyboard alot! the click feels comfortable and the travel is good as well!           
            </p>
